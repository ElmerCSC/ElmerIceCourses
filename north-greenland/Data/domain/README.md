# Model domain

This directory contains a shapefile that is a collection of lines that describe the 2D domain contour.

This shapefile has been created by F. Gillet-Chaulet from the 1.1 and 1.2 [IMBIE drainage bassins](http://imbie.org/imbie-2016/drainage-basins) in north Greenland.
The bassins have been extended up to the continent edge to allow the advance of land terminating glaciers up to the ocean.

See **Elmer/Step1/** to create a 2D mesh from this shapefile.
