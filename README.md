# Elmer/Ice Course Repository
Elmer/Ice course repository containing example cases and slide material. Check the README files of the different subdirectories (listed in the order of the course):
* **Testglacier-flowine**: introductory example of a synthetic 2D glacier to get aquainted with Elmer/Ice
* **TeteRousse**: 3D introductory example of a small alpine glacier with a water cavity at its base
* **northern-greenland**: shallow-shelf approximation (SSA) based example of a setup for an ice-sheet problem. Including mesh optimization, basal slip inversion and coupling to climate input using NetCDF files (needs an enhanced build of Elmer)
